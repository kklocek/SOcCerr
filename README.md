# SOcCerr

My little assingnment for operating systems.

This small game is written in C, using Unix system mechanisms like sockets, signals and file I/O.

Maybe in the future I will improve code structure, now it's messy (because I don't have much time :/ ).

USAGE:
1. Download the repo
2. make all	
3. ./server <port> - to run a server on the specific port
4. ./client - to run a client

HOW TO PLAY:
 2 3 4 
  \|/ 
1 -o- 5
  /|\ 
 8 7 6

That's the table of moves - input digit in game to move in appropriate direction.

Next part of this doc: in the future, maybe.
