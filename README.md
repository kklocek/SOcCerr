# SOcCerr

My little assingnment for operating systems.

This small game is written in C, using Unix system mechanisms like sockets, signals and file I/O.

Maybe in the future I will improve code structure, now it's messy (because I don't have much time :/ ).

USAGE:
1. Download the repo
2. make all	
3. ./server <port> - to run a server on the specific port
4. ./client - to run a client
